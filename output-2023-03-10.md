During what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakumatsu">Bakumatsu</a>, the Tokugawa shogunate (basically a military dictatorship) found itself unwillingly ending its 200-year-long reign &#x2014; foreign forces clashed with Japan, and the country underwent profound changes through rapid industrialization. I can only recommend looking up this fascinating period in Japan&apos;s history. But back to the game: I have been playing <em>Like A Dragon: Ishin!</em> on Steam Deck, and while it runs without any significant hiccups, a few minor changes to the <a href="https://overkill.wtf/how-to-graphic-settings-steam-deck/">graphical settings</a> make for a much better experience.</p><h2 id="how-does-like-a-dragon-ishin-run-on-steam-deck">How does <em>Like A Dragon: Ishin!</em> run on Steam Deck?</h2><p>The game defaults to an &quot;Extra Low&quot; settings preset at launch.</p><p>Without changing anything, the game automatically targets 60 FPS &#x2014; although it quickly becomes apparent that it cannot keep locked at a constant framerate. While running around in the starting area, it keeps hovering between 55 and 60 FPS, with dips to below 40 FPS during combat.</p><p>Locking the Steam Deck&apos;s screen to a refresh rate of 40 stabilized the framerate, even when putting the in-game settings to Medium (I kept the in-game FPS toggle at 60).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://overkill.wtf/content/images/2023/02/ishin-40fps.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Like A Dragon: Ishin! Review: Settings and Performance on Steam Deck" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="750" srcset="https://overkill.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/ishin-40fps.jpg 600w, https://overkill.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/ishin-40fps.jpg 1000w, https://overkill.wtf/content/images/2023/02/ishin-40fps.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Look at that framerate.</figcaption></figure><p>The Steam Deck also managed to run the game when switching the in-game settings to High, and I was still seeing a reasonably constant 40 FPS, though the GPU usage climbed to around 90 per cent. Having things set at this level would burn through the battery too quickly, even for my liking, so I switched it back to Medium. But to be completely honest, I did not see a big difference between setting the game to High compared to having it on Medium settings.</p><p>So, the takeaway recommendation is this: <strong>set the Steam Deck&apos;s Refresh Rate and the Framerate Limit to 40, and you can switch the in-game graphical preset to Medium</strong>. A few hours in, this posed no significant issues for me.</p><p>One side note, though. Some cutscenes are pre-rendered and run at 30 FPS. These look great, but the game sometimes switches to a cutscene-like dialogue prompt (that you can progress by pressing A).

During what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakumatsu">Bakumatsu</a>, the Tokugawa shogunate (basically a military dictatorship) found itself unwillingly ending its 200-year-long reign &#x2014; foreign forces clashed with Japan, and the country underwent profound changes through rapid industrialization. I can only recommend looking up this fascinating period in Japan&apos;s history. But back to the game: I have been playing <em>Like A Dragon: Ishin!</em> on Steam Deck, and while it runs without any significant hiccups, a few minor changes to the <a href="https://overkill.wtf/how-to-graphic-settings-steam-deck/">graphical settings</a> make for a much better experience.</p><h2 id="how-does-like-a-dragon-ishin-run-on-steam-deck">How does <em>Like A Dragon: Ishin!</em> run on Steam Deck?</h2><p>The game defaults to an &quot;Extra Low&quot; settings preset at launch.</p><p>Without changing anything, the game automatically targets 60 FPS &#x2014; although it quickly becomes apparent that it cannot keep locked at a constant framerate. While running around in the starting area, it keeps hovering between 55 and 60 FPS, with dips to below 40 FPS during combat.</p><p>Locking the Steam Deck&apos;s screen to a refresh rate of 40 stabilized the framerate, even when putting the in-game settings to Medium (I kept the in-game FPS toggle at 60).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://overkill.wtf/content/images/2023/02/ishin-40fps.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Like A Dragon: Ishin!

Having things set at this level would burn through the battery too quickly, even for my liking, so I switched it back to Medium. But to be completely honest, I did not see a big difference between setting the game to High compared to having it on Medium settings.</p><p>So, the takeaway recommendation is this: <strong>set the Steam Deck&apos;s Refresh Rate and the Framerate Limit to 40, and you can switch the in-game graphical preset to Medium</strong>. A few hours in, this posed no significant issues for me.</p><p>One side note, though. Some cutscenes are pre-rendered and run at 30 FPS. These look great, but the game sometimes switches to a cutscene-like dialogue prompt (that you can progress by pressing A). These scenes render in-engine, and therefore, you&apos;ll notice a jump back to whatever your graphical settings are set at (such as Medium at 40 FPS). So, what might look like a cutscene, isn&apos;t one. The difference in both the optics and the framerate is clearly visible. The contrast is a little stark sometimes, and I felt it hurt immersion a little too much.</p><hr><h2 id="you-can-bring-a-gun-to-a-sword-fight">You can bring a gun to a sword fight</h2><p>Fans of the series will quickly realize that <em>Like A Dragon: Ishin!</em> does not feature the turn-based combat later titles of the <em>Like A Dragon </em>series adopted, but goes back to its roots as a semi-open-world brawler &#x2014; in which players can choose between four different fighting styles: a fist fight, sword fighting, gun-slinging, and a mix between katana and gun fights.</p><p>Every fighting style has its advantages and disadvantages, but I quickly defaulted to using both the sword and the gun simultaneously.

During what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakumatsu">Bakumatsu</a>, the Tokugawa shogunate (basically a military dictatorship) found itself unwillingly ending its 200-year-long reign &#x2014; foreign forces clashed with Japan, and the country underwent profound changes through rapid industrialization. I can only recommend looking up this fascinating period in Japan&apos;s history. But back to the game: I have been playing <em>Like A Dragon: Ishin!</em> on Steam Deck, and while it runs without any significant hiccups, a few minor changes to the <a href="https://overkill.wtf/how-to-graphic-settings-steam-deck/">graphical settings</a> make for a much better experience.</p><h2 id="how-does-like-a-dragon-ishin-run-on-steam-deck">How does <em>Like A Dragon: Ishin!</em> run on Steam Deck?</h2><p>The game defaults to an &quot;Extra Low&quot; settings preset at launch.</p><p>Without changing anything, the game automatically targets 60 FPS &#x2014; although it quickly becomes apparent that it cannot keep locked at a constant framerate. While running around in the starting area, it keeps hovering between 55 and 60 FPS, with dips to below 40 FPS during combat.</p><p>Locking the Steam Deck&apos;s screen to a refresh rate of 40 stabilized the framerate, even when putting the in-game settings to Medium (I kept the in-game FPS toggle at 60).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://overkill.wtf/content/images/2023/02/ishin-40fps.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Like A Dragon: Ishin! Review: Settings and Performance on Steam Deck" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="750" srcset="https://overkill.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/ishin-40fps.jpg 600w, https://overkill.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/ishin-40fps.jpg 1000w, https://overkill.wtf/content/images/2023/02/ishin-40fps.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Look at that framerate.</figcaption></figure><p>The Steam Deck also managed to run the game when switching the in-game settings to High, and I was still seeing a reasonably constant 40 FPS, though the GPU usage climbed to around 90 per cent. Having things set at this level would burn through the battery too quickly, even for my liking, so I switched it back to Medium. But to be completely honest, I did not see a big difference between setting the game to High compared to having it on Medium settings.</p><p>So, the takeaway recommendation is this: <strong>set the Steam Deck&apos;s Refresh Rate and the Framerate Limit to 40, and you can switch the in-game graphical preset to Medium</strong>. A few hours in, this posed no significant issues for me.</p><p>One side note, though. Some cutscenes are pre-rendered and run at 30 FPS. These look great, but the game sometimes switches to a cutscene-like dialogue prompt (that you can progress by pressing A). These scenes render in-engine, and therefore, you&apos;ll notice a jump back to whatever your graphical settings are set at (such as Medium at 40 FPS). So, what might look like a cutscene, isn&apos;t one. The difference in both the optics and the framerate is clearly visible. The contrast is a little stark sometimes, and I felt it hurt immersion a little too much.</p><hr><h2 id="you-can-bring-a-gun-to-a-sword-fight">You can bring a gun to a sword fight</h2><p>Fans of the series will quickly realize that <em>Like A Dragon: Ishin!</em> does not feature the turn-based combat later titles of the <em>Like A Dragon </em>series adopted, but goes back to its roots as a semi-open-world brawler &#x2014; in which players can choose between four different fighting styles: a fist fight, sword fighting, gun-slinging, and a mix between katana and gun fights.</p><p>Every fighting style has its advantages and disadvantages, but I quickly defaulted to using both the sword and the gun simultaneously. I hate parrying and prefer quickly dodging in and out, something this fighting style encourages. This allows you to quickly land blows with the sword and then finish the enemies with some bullets from your gun. This style, called the Wild Dancer style, is excellent for crowd control, too, but lacks the damage needed for heavier enemies. So, in this way, the game still encourages you to switch styles.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://overkill.wtf/content/images/2023/02/ishin-skilltree-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Like A Dragon: Ishin!

You also have an arsenal of different equipment at your disposal, from weapons enhancing your Attack points to gear improving your Defense points.</p><p>In typical Yakuza/Like A Dragon fashion, Ishin features a plethora of little mini-games, from a farming simulator to a cooking mini-game to a drinking contest over to Strip-Rock-Paper-Scissors &#x2013; without ever taking itself too seriously.</p><hr><p>As for the story, I haven&apos;t played enough of the game yet to give a full assessment (<em>according to <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/113549">How Long to Beat</a>, the main story takes about 22 hours, with a whopping 97 hours if you are a completionist</em>), but as someone fascinated by Japanese culture (yes, I&apos;m a weeb), I love the setting, the world building and the comedy present in <em>Like A Dragon: Ishin!</em></p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-white"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F3AE;</div><div class="kg-callout-text"><em>Like A Dragon: Ishin! </em>is one of several titles in the <em>Like A Dragon </em>series.
